## Descriptive Analytics
All descriptive analysis is available through two [Tableau] (https://www.tableau.com/en-gb) dashboards
- [Descriptive - Meter and Hour] (https://public.tableau.com/profile/jenniffer.guerrero#!/vizhome/Descriptive-MeterandHour/Meter) Information for individual meters and for each category with hourly granularity
- [Descriptive - Day, Month, Holidays, Stats and Weather] (https://public.tableau.com/profile/jenniffer.guerrero#!/vizhome/Descriptive-DayMonthHolidaysStatsandWeather/Day) Information with daily and monthly granularity for each household category.
